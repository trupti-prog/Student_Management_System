'Student Management System,' is a GUI based python project designed to maintain students record. This project mainly focuses on CRUD operations i.e. CREATE, READ, UPDATE & DELETE, where data is accessed through sqlite3. A connection object is connected to the database which lets user to execute SQL statements, creating a new file(stu.db). To start editing into the system, first user will have to input its location which is the part of data extraction. The main window pops up displaying buttons like ADD, VIEW, UPDATE, DELETE, CHARTS & labels like Loc, Temp, Quote of the day. The student data includes rno, name & marks where rno is unique with validations like rno can't be empty and it should be positive, name can't be empty & should contain alphabets with min 2 length, marks can't be empty and should be in range between 0 to 100. To add record, user will have to enter rno, name & marks. To update record, user will have to update name or marks in the existing student rno. To delete record, user will have to enter existing rno. Later, user can view the students record. Charts button will plot bar chart dispalying students name & marks which is a part of data visualization.
